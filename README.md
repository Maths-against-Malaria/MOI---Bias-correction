This repository contains R functions to derive etimates and generate simulated data according to the methods and models described in the paper "Bias-corrected maximum-likelihood estimation of multiplicityof infection and lineage frequencies". To import/merge molecular data of any type (STR, SNPs, amino acids) and format and apply further analysis please refer to the the R package "MLMOI" (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MLMOI/index.html).

Description of the functions included in the repository:

1. **MLE**: derives the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) of the MOI parameter (Poisson parameter) and the lineage (allele) frequencies;
2. **BCMLE**: derives the bias-corrected maximum-likelihood estimate (BCMLE) of the MOI parameter (Poisson parameter) and the lineage (allele) frequencies;
3. **HBCML1**
